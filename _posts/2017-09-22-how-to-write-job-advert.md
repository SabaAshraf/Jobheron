There’s nothing worse than posting a job ad for a position you really need filled and not getting any responses. Or worse, being inundated with applications from people who are completely unsuitable.This can happen for lots of reasons, but a poorly written job advert is often the culprit.When it comes to the recruitment <!--more--> process, the job ad is sometimes an afterthought. But – think about it – it’s actually a crucial marketing tool. After all, it’s the only piece of information that potentially amazing candidates will have about the role and your company. So, you need to get it right.

**How should it be done?**

Approach the job ad like you would any other piece of advertising. It should be engaging, address your audience in language they understand, convince them to buy into your company, and offer them what they want.

It’s a tall order, but here are five tips to help you write a killer job ad that’ll have top talent applying in their droves.

**Don’t make it too long**

We all have shorter attention spans and less free time than ever, so your job ad need to be succinct and to the point. Think of it as more of a movie trailer than War and Peace.

The most effective ads consist of around 185 characters, with a job title length of just 29 characters. So be precise and make every word count. You can explain the finer details at the interview stage.

**Write an ad, not a job spec**

A common mistake made by companies is using the job spec as the job ad. This is a big no-no. While it’s okay to use elements of the job spec in the ad, the two serve very different purposes.

A job spec is a detailed manual of requirements written by a hiring manager. It’s generally long, boring and best left to be sent to candidates prior to the interview, where the detail will be a plus.

If you post a job spec, it’ll make for a terrible ad, and you’ll likely get a very poor response.

**Don’t ask for a cover letter**

We’re all pressed for time. This includes you, as well as the candidates applying for the role. So make the application process as simple as possible. Adding unnecessary steps such as a cover letter will only alienate people.

Not only this, but today, a lot of people review and apply for jobs on their mobiles while on the go. Overcomplicating the process could lead you to miss out on top talent.

**Make sure you mention the salary**

According to reed.co.uk, roles advertised with salaries receive three times more applicants than those without. It’s a no brainer. If you don’t mention the salary or related company benefits, you’ll be less likely to get good quality applications.

If your vacancy has an OTE, quote the basic plus the potential income for the first year. It’ll make the package much more appealing.

**Be location specific**

Job adverts with a specific location receive, on average, 10 times as many applications as those that keep it vague. This is because jobseekers tend to search for roles by postcode, or a specific area.

Although this can be tricky for some roles, like an Area Sales Manager, listing one or two anchor locations (e.g. Birmingham for the West Midlands) will help boost numbers.

**Further advice**

Writing a quality job ad is an art form, and the above are just a few of the common mistakes that keep employers from finding top talent they want.
